# Automatically detects if it is running in debug mode (inside "target/debug" directory) and escapes that path.

# GENERAL VALIDATION
# The "validate" command looks through all the libraries and attemps
# to spot any weird or invalid folder structure and files.

[validation]
# These are the audio file extensions you allow in your libraries.

# These are the file extensions you don't want to get alterted for.
# (if a file's extension is not in ignored_file_extension nor in audio_file_extensions, that will trigger an error)
ignored_file_extensions = ["png", "jpg", "jpeg", "txt", "md", "log", "cue", "m3u8"]

# LIBRARY
####
# Library structure is expected to be:
#  <library directory>
#  |-- <artist>
#  |   |-- <album>
#  |   |   |-- <... audio files>
#  |   |   |-- <... cover art>
#  |   |   |-- <... possibly some album-related README, etc.>
#  |   |   |-- <... possibly other directory that don't matter>
#  |   |-- <... possibly some artist-related README, etc.>
#  | ...
#  |--
#
# Add additional libraries (as many as you need) by adding keys to the "libraries" key as shown below.

audio_file_extensions = ["flac"]
# Generally files with extension not in audio_file_extensions are treated as non-audio files and ignored during validation.

####
# AGGREGATED LIBRARY
# The philosophy of this music library manager is that you should split your library
# into smaller parts: one for lossless audio, one for lossy, one for a specific collection, etc.
# However, this philosophy also acknowledges that you might want to take the library with you on the go,
# something that is hard to do when it is contains possibly huge lossless files.
#
# This is why the aggregation ("transcode" in most of the UI) exists. It takes all of your registered "sub"-libraries
# (see libraries configuration above) and transcodes them down into MP3 V0 into a single aggregated library you may
# then take along with you.
####
[aggregated_library]
path = "{ROOT}/MusicLibrary"


####
# FILE METADATA
# In order to optimize the speed and remove redundant transcodes, this music library manager
# actually "tracks" your album files via a special dotfile called ".librarymeta" (placed in each album directory).
# Implementation details are available in the README, however the purpouse of this is to
# understand when a file has changed and must be reencoded (if it's an audio file) or recopied (if it's a data file)
####
[file_metadata]
# Files with these extensions count as audio files and will be converted into MP3 V0 during the aggregation process.
tracked_audio_extensions = [
    "mp3", "flac", "alac", "m4a", "ogg"
]
# Files with these extension count as data files and will be simply copied over into the aggregated library.
tracked_data_extensions = [
    "png", "jpg", "jpeg", "gif"
]
# NOTE: All other files are untracked.
