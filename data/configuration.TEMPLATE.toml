# - aggregated_library.

# TOOLS
# Contains configuration regarding external tools that are used (ffmpeg, etc.).

[tools]
# This music manager uses ffmpeg as its workhorse for audio conversion. Its configuration is available below.

# Relative path from the base directory (meaning the directory containing the executable).
# Automatically detects if it is running in debug mode (inside "target/debug" directory) and escapes that path.

# This represents the arguments passed to ffmpeg when converting an audio file into MP3 V0.
# The placeholders {INPUT_FILE} and {OUTPUT_FILE} will be replaced with the absolute path to those files on runtime.

# LIBRARY VALIDATION
# The "validate-all" command looks through all available libraries and attemps to spot any unusual or downright
# invalid folder structure and files. The function of the settings below is to give some defaults for each library
# regarding non-audio ("other") files. This is intended for stuff like allowing cover art files, logs, playlists, etc.
####
[validation]
# The distinction between audio (you'll see it below) and other files is made to detect erroneous audio files in
# e.g. the root or artist directory. To be clear: "other" files mean files everywhere,
# but "audio" files mean those only in the album directories.
allowed_other_files_by_extension = ["png", "jpg", "jpeg", "txt", "md", "log", "cue", "m3u8"]
# These files are always ignored and do not cause validation errors (these are matched by full file name).
# (".librarymeta" is a mandatory entry if you use the transcode commands)
allowed_other_files_by_name = [".librarymeta"]
# NOTE: If a file without a valid extension or name match is found during the scan, it is marked
# as an unexpected file and makes the validation fail (this is the entire point of validation).

# LIBRARY

# Library structure is expected to be:

# AGGREGATED LIBRARY
# The philosophy of this music library manager is that you should split your library
# into smaller parts: one for lossless audio, one for lossy, one for a specific collection, etc.
# However, this philosophy also acknowledges that you might want to take the library with you on the go,
# something that is hard to do when it is contains possibly huge lossless files.
#
# This is why the aggregation ("transcode" in most of the CLI) exists. It takes all of your registered "sub-libraries"
# (see `libraries` above) and transcodes them down into MP3 V0 into a single aggregated library you may then take along with you.
####
[aggregated_library]
path = "{LIBRARY_BASE}/MusicLibrary"


####
# FILE METADATA
# In order to optimize the speed and remove redundant transcodes, euphony actually "tracks" your album files
# via a special dotfile called ".librarymeta" (placed in each album directory).
# Implementation details are available in the README, but the general idea and purpouse of those files are to
# understand when any single file has changed and has to be reencoded (if it's an audio file) or recopied (if it's a data file).
####
[file_metadata]
# Files with these extensions count as audio files and will be converted into MP3 V0 during the aggregation process.
# There are no library-specific settings here.
tracked_audio_extensions = [
    "mp3", "flac", "alac", "m4a", "ogg"
]
# Files with these extension count as data files and will be simply copied over into the aggregated library.
tracked_other_extensions = [
    "png", "jpg", "jpeg", "gif"
]
# NOTE: All other files are untracked.
